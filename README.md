Note to self:
Most things are conditional. A little bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript can go a long way with your browser. Yes, you may have access to the DOM. Yes, you may manipulate it. Yes, you may have access to the Window and local storage.

...but can you beat my high score of a gagillion with the right tweaks to monster coordinates?!
